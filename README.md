STOIC Perspective creation
=================

Minimal code to implement a new perspective. Dendrogram is provided as an example.

A demo is accessible at http://floribon.github.io/stoic-perspective/

To add a new perspective:

1. Create a new file or duplicate stc_dendrogram.js
2. Add it to index.html (under the reference to the dendrogram file) 
3. Edit demoController.js by changing dendrogramPerspective references by your own perspective.
