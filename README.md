STOIC Perspective creation
=================

Minimal code to implement a new perspective. Dendrogram is provided as an example.

A demo is accessible at https://github.com/floribon/stoic-perspective

To add a new perspective:

1. Create a new file or duplicate stc_dendrogram.js
2. Add it to index.html (under the reference to the dendrogram file) 
3. Edit demoController.js by changing dendrogramperspective references by your own perspective.
